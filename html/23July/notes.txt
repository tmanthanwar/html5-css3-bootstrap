1) How does html code gets executed in the browser?
 
 - When we give our code to the browser, browser send that code to server. 
   Server returns a file in HTML text format with response header having content type html/text 
   and character code utf-8. 

2) DOM (Document Object Model) 
 - Browser picks every html element and converts into objects and put that object in tree format.
