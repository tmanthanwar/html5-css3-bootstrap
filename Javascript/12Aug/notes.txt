Datatypes -

Data types represent typeod data stored in a variable. 

var str = "hello" // string
var num = 123 // Number
var bolean = true // boolean

String - 

var str = "hello"
str.concat("world");
console.log(str); // hello 

Why this- Because strings are immutable. it can not be modified. it is not going to reinitialized the string.
Whenever you perform any operation it creates a new string. and that why you have to reassigned it.
